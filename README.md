# staticAnimations
Code and accompanying files for the article: Deformation Spaces and Static Animations__


This repository contains code to help the user work alongside the tutorial (Section 5.2) in the article referenced above.  This includes:<br>
--A Mathematica notebook for generating an image stack of deforming polar stars (StarPlot.nb)__
--A complete image stack of polar stars in PNG format (Folder containing files of the form polarStar_XXXX.PNG)__
--A STL file exported from Chimera before postprocessing (starPlotPreProcess.stl)__
--A post prosessed STL of the static animation that is ready to print (starPlotPostProcess.stl)__
__
We also include:__
--A Mathematica notebook for generating image stacks of deformations of Julia sets (JuliaPlots.nb).__
----This Mathematica notebook was initially written by Bernat Espigule, and has been slightly adjusted by myself.__
----It is initially set up to traverse the upper half of the main cardioid.__
----The user can (and should!!) modify the parametrized curve to explore other static animations corresponding to curves in the Mandlebrot set.__
