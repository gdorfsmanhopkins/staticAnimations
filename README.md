# staticAnimations
Code and accompanying files for the article: Deformation Spaces and Static Animations<br><br><br>


This repository contains code to help the user work alongside the tutorial (Section 5.2) in the article referenced above.  This includes:<br>
--A python program for generating an image stack of deforming polar stars (starPlot.py)<br>
--A Mathematica notebook for generating an image stack of deforming polar stars (starPlot.nb)<br>
--A python program for removing the alpha layer from a stack of RGBA PNGs (alphaRemover.py)<br>
--A complete image stack of polar stars in PNG format (Folder containing files of the form flowers_XXXX.PNG)<br>
--A STL file exported from Chimera before (flower_model.stl)<br><br>

We also include:<br>
--A Mathematica notebook for generating image stacks of deformations of Julia sets (JuliaPlots.nb).<br>
----This Mathematica notebook was initially written by Bernat Espigule, and has been slightly adjusted by myself.<br>
----It is initially set up to traverse the upper half of the main cardioid.<br>
----The user can (and should!!) modify the parametrized curve to explore other static animations corresponding to curves in the Mandlebrot set.<br>
